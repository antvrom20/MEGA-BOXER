      <p><u><b>Welcome to Mega Boxer!</b></u><br>
      The goal of the game is to kill 50 enemies!<br>
      Here's Some controls to get you started:<br>
      WASD: Move<br>
      Mouse: Look<br>
      Space: Block<br>
      Q: Punch<br>
      E: Power Punch!<br>
      <br>
      <div id="full_disc">  
        Originally, the game was intended to be a online PVP based experience , but we simply couldn't achieve this as well as a planned mixed reality mode<br> due to a misunderstanding of the complexity of these features. Hopefully, in a later update and with more understanding,<br>we can add these features back in!<br>
        <h2><u>Top Tips!</u></h2><br>
        <h3>So, the game may seem pretty easy at face value, but it's actually quite hard to beat. Here are some tips to help you out:</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="toptips"> 
        - The standard punch is the most effective, but the power punch is the most powerful. The power punch is a little stronger, but it's much more clumsier to use, has a two second cooldown, and is somewhat inaccureate!<br>
        - The enemy spawn rate is pretty high, and it can seriosly get overwheling at times! The best way to go about this is to use your space to your advantage. Feel free to move around the space!<br>
        - The extremely mystical tree of weirdos is very powerful...but it's also very dangerous. It'll kill any enemy that gets too close to it, but it's very spiteful. It thinks that you should've been able to kill those enemies, so out of spite, it does some damage to you! Make sure the enemies don't touch it!<br>
        - Keep your guard up! When you attack, your gloves arent at your face to protect you, so enemies do slightly more damage! It may not seem noticible at first, but when you're surrounded by enemies...<br>
        - You want to keep killing enemies to ensure you don't run out of time. Each enemy killed adds +5 seconds to your game time!<br>
        - Each enemy you kill gives you +10 health points, so your health can actually be greater than 100!<br>
        - Button spamming will get you nowhere here! You cant spam a punch in real life, so why would you be able to do it here!<br>
        - Ok, it'll get you somewhere actually...holding down the Q key will start a fury of punches that'll only last for a second and work at an <i>extremely</i> close range!
